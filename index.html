                        Hello everyone! I'm Brock Pittman, an aspiring game developer and Software Programmer. I graduated from North Carolina State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Game Development. Throughout college I had worked on many small projects where I have honed my skills related to software development and game design. Currently, while on the job search, I have been delving into other aspects of game development besides programming to help better my understanding of what goes into fully making a game, such as art, animation, and SFX. My current major project is "The Dark Forest" which attempts to use sound as the main means of player navigation. If you have any questions or wish to learn more about my projects, feel free to reach out!
