Ardenfell is a 3rd person souls-like game which was created as my 
independent study semester-long project. The game aims to mimic 
certain elements of a typical Dark Souls games, such as the leveling
systems, play style, and summoning systems for multiplayer.

I took on the role of managing the player camera, and its lock on 
functionality, as well as the summoning system, including the 
networking and replication that it would entail. In addition, due
to having the mostexperience with Dark Souls games, I also acted 
as a resource for my teammates to double check their work and 
although my team was unable to complete a full level, I believe 
we had come out with a decent base to expand upon in the future. 
I was able to learn a lot about Unreal Engine's networking and 
Gameplay Ability System as well as producing a game with a 
multi-talented team.

The InnBetween is a Fortnite island created during  one week with
a small team as a part of the Triangle Game Jam. The game focuses
on maintaining a restaurant by trying to keep up with customer 
orders, preparemeals, and deliver the meals to the customers with
a limited amount of hands.

I took on the role of restricting the player and ensuring they
didn't have access to particular elements normally found in 
Fortnite, such as limiting the amount of items, in this case,
ingredients, so they would have to make multiple trips and plan 
their cooking route. In addition, I also helped track the food 
the player was holding so they could perform their food deliveries. 
The project was a great opportunity to further my skill and 
knowledge of Verse, the programming language used within UEFN, as 
well as get to know more of the creative devices that UEFN has to 
offer.

The Educational Game Creation Tool acted as my Senior Design final
project. The College of Business at North Carolina State University
acted as our sponsor and asked for a tool that they could use that
could create small education visual novel type games that could be
used to grade assignments. My team decided to create a plugin 
within Godot that would take away most to all of the complexities
of the engine and make it solely be able to make these types of 
games with ease of use for teachers and non-game developers.

I took on the role of managing images that could be added to our 
system. I allowed for a user to insert any image they would want 
and use them as either background images or graphs for a particular 
question or scene. In addition, I worked on connecting our tool to 
our exporting tool so the games in the tool would correctly reflect 
on the output game. The project acted as a great opportunity to act 
as a company working with clients to create and iterate upon a 
program. We used an agile approach and met with the client weekly 
to see what they liked and what needed changes or improvements.

Chipmunk Defense was a 2D defense game that acted as my submission
for the Ludum Dare 56 game jam. I decided to do this jam solo and in 
one day to test myself and see what I could make in one day. I used 
Aseprite to make all the assets and although they didn't turn out 
great, I find them quite charming. Overall, this was a really fun 
experience and set me on the track to wanting to learn more about
how pixel/texel art should be made.

Galaxian 3D is a 3D variant of the Galaxian arcade game made as 
my Computer Graphics final project. My team tried to retain as 
much of the original gameplay mechanics and systems as much as 
we could, while also attemtping to add a bit of challenge due to
the 3D space. A few changes we made were to have the enemies 
surround the player as opposed to be in front of them to make it 
more of a dog fight and we made one type of enemy progressively 
get harder to deal with that attempted to learn as levels 
progressed. 

My role in the project was to implement all but the learning 
enemies behavior. I learned and utilized Unreal Engine 5's 
behavior trees to create different variants of ships, such as 
escorts, fighters, and the galboss and had them mimic their 
original Galaxian behavior.

The Lost Shadow is a 3D puzzle game made for a Video Game 
Development Club at NCState's semester game jam. The goal of the
game is to utilize the ability to move objects around a light source 
and swap between controlling the character and it's shadow to finish
a level. Objects can be moved around a 3D space and be utilized to 
create platforms with the shadows they cast for the players shadow 
to use.

Due to the heavy classwork at the time, for this project I had more 
of a design and tester role. I mainly helped to ideate many of the 
game components and helped to debug any issues my teammates had in 
their code.

1v1 Arena is a Fortnite island created during the summer period
between semesters. The game is a fairly simple 1v1 game where
players are placed into a queue based on a winstreak up to 4, with
the fourth level arena giving the most points per win.

The project acted as an introduction to UEFN for my partner and I. 
Much of the project I spent learning Verse, the tools of UEFN, and 
the available creative devices I could use to create parts of the 
game. My main role was creating the spaces that would be the arenas 
around the map, determing what weapons would be viable and how to 
use Verse and creative devices to modify game properties, as well as
testing.

The Dark Horse was a game that contained 4 different micro games 
thatacted as my teams Game Design final project. The aim of the 
game is to get through all the microgames to wake up from a dream 
and figure out the true game you are playing.

Each team member created there own microgame, so I decided to make a 
small jousting game that acted similar to dinosaur game but made use 
of a javelin to deal with enemies. I designed and implemented every 
aspect of my microgame.

Kaching is a 2D top-down zombie survival game. Kaching was my first 
major game project upon entering college and my first time 
participating in a game jam. The main mechanic of the game is that 
coins are your ammo. In order to get more coins zombies must be 
defeated to drop dollar bills, which will then allow you to purchase 
upgrades at vending machines. Vending machines will then dispense 
your change which acts as your ammo resupply.

Due to this being my first game jam, and first time using a game 
engine for a project, I kept my role small and mainly focused on 
coming up with and iterating on our teams game idea, as well as 
implementing small aspects of the player character.

The Dark Forest is a 3D horror game that aims to use sound as the 
main means of giving the player a way to navigate. Much of the game 
will be low visibility and require the player to listen closely to 
figure out where they need to go. 

As my partner and I have hit a roadblock that is halting 
development, my main role for now is making art and assets as well 
as figuring out how we can use sound in a way that is enjoyable to 
the player until we can flesh out more of the game.

Samurai Game is a project my partner and I are ideating that 
combines elements of Devil May Cry, Sekiro, and classic 
Metroidvanias, while keeping to the aesthetics of steam/cyber/solar 
punk and grunge.

As a project in my Game AI course, I worked on testing algorithms 
for seeking, flocking, and pathfinding in C++. The algorithms used 
were taught as to the class and I, based on my development 
environment, tested different input values to see what looked most 
natural.

For this project, I modeled and assembled a game engine from scratch 
in C++ utiliing a few helpful libraries such as SFML. Implemented 
features include collision detection, multithreading, networking, 
and a little bit of scripting. The porject acted as my Gane Engines 
semester long project. I utilized this project as an opportunity to 
learn C++ in addition to the finer details of how game engines work.

connecting to the server.

CoffeeMaker was a fullstack project acting as my Software 
Engineering final project. We created a nice looking Coffee Maker 
interface utilizing GitHub pages and had it connect to a MySQL 
database to help track coffee orders, ingredients, and other 
information.
