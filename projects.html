Ardenfell is a 3rd person souls-like game which was created as my 
independent study semester-long project. The game aims to mimic 
certain elements of a typical Dark Souls games, such as the leveling
systems, play style, and summoning systems for multiplayer.

I took on the role of managing the player camera, and its lock on 
functionality, as well as the summoning system, including the 
networking and replication that it would entail. In addition, due
to having the mostexperience with Dark Souls games, I also acted 
as a resource for my teammates to double check their work and 
although my team was unable to complete a full level, I believe 
we had come out with a decent base to expand upon in the future. 
I was able to learn a lot about Unreal Engine's networking and 
Gameplay Ability System as well as producing a game with a 
multi-talented team.

The InnBetween is a Fortnite island created during  one week with
a small team as a part of the Triangle Game Jam. The game focuses
on maintaining a restaurant by trying to keep up with customer 
orders, preparemeals, and deliver the meals to the customers with
a limited amount of hands.

I took on the role of restricting the player and ensuring they
didn't have access to particular elements normally found in 
Fortnite, such as limiting the amount of items, in this case,
ingredients, so they would have to make multiple trips and plan 
their cooking route. In addition, I also helped track the food 
the player was holding so they could perform their food deliveries. 
The project was a great opportunity to further my skill and 
knowledge of Verse, the programming language used within UEFN, as 
well as get to know more of the creative devices that UEFN has to 
offer.

The Educational Game Creation Tool acted as my Senior Design final
project. The College of Business at North Carolina State University
acted as our sponsor and asked for a tool that they could use that
could create small education visual novel type games that could be
used to grade assignments. My team decided to create a plugin within
Godot that would take away most to all of the complexities of the
engine and make it solely be able to make these types of games
with ease of use for teachers and non-game developers.

I took on the role of managing images that could be added to our 
system. I allowed for a user to insert any image they would want 
and use them as either background images or graphs for a particular 
question or scene. In addition, I worked on connecting our tool to 
our exporting tool so the games in the tool would correctly reflect 
on the output game. The project acted as a great opportunity to act 
as a company working with clients to create and iterate upon a 
program. We used an agile approach and met with the client weekly 
to see what they liked and what needed changes or improvements.

Chipmunk Defense was a 2D defense game that acted as my submission
for the Ludum Dare 56 game jam. I decided to do this jam solo and 
in one day to test myself and see what I could make in one day.
I used Aseprite to make all the assets and although they didn't 
turn out great, I find them quite charming. Overall, this was a 
really fun experience and set me on the track to wanting to learn
more about how pixel/texel art should be made.

Galaxian 3D is a 3D variant of the Galaxian arcade game made as 
my Computer Graphics final project. My team tried to retain as 
much of the original gameplay mechanics and systems as much as 
we could, while also attemtping to add a bit of challenge due to
the 3D space. A few changes we made were to have the enemies 
surround the player as opposed to be in front of them to make it 
more of a dog fight and we made one type of enemy progressively 
get harder to deal with that attempted to learn as levels 
progressed. 

My role in the project was to implement all but the learning 
enemies behavior. I learned and utilized Unreal Engine 5's 
behavior trees to create different variants of ships, such as 
escorts, fighters, and the galboss and had them mimic their 
original Galaxian behavior.
